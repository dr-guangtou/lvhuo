# Lvhuo (驴火, or 驴肉火烧)

----

Image stacking analysis for Hyper Suprime-Cam data

Placeholder for future development. The name is suggested by Weibo (微博) user @桂宮文麿惟仁。"Lvhuo" means ["Donkey burger"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_burger).  Yes, it is "burger" with donkey meat, which is very famous in my grandapa's hometown, Bao Ding (保定)。 Although it is kind of weird to think about eating donkey in western country, it is actually very popular in China for a long, long time. There is literatually a saying goes like "In Heaven there is dragon meat, on Earth there is donkey meat" (天上龙肉，地上驴肉)。
